# C++ Array Utilities

Welcome to **C++ Array Utilities**, a powerful C++ program that provides a comprehensive set of tools for creating, analyzing, and manipulating arrays. Whether you are learning C++ or building complex programs, this project offers practical utilities to handle arrays efficiently.

## Features

* **Random Array Creation:** Generate arrays with random numbers.
* **Array Manipulation:** Copy, reverse, shuffle, and sum arrays element-wise.
* **Array Analysis:** Find max, min, sum, average, check prime numbers, even/odd numbers, palindromes, and distinct elements.
* **Filtering & Searching:** Extract prime numbers, even numbers, odd numbers, and search for specific elements.
* **Dynamic Input:** Add numbers interactively to arrays.
* **Math Utilities:** Compute absolute value, round, floor, and ceil of floating-point numbers.
* **Key Generation:** Generate random alphanumeric keys for unique identifiers.
